# üìö Library Management System

A **Library Management System** built with **Java Spring Boot** and a relational database to manage books, members, system users, and borrowing transactions.  
This project was developed as part of a technical challenge to demonstrate skills in backend development, database design, role-based access control, and RESTful API design.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Library Management System provides a secure and efficient way to:

- Manage **books** with extended metadata (authors, publishers, categories, language, publication year, ISBN, edition, summary, cover images).
- Manage **members** (borrowers) with personal and membership details.
- Manage **system users** (Administrator, Librarian, Staff) with **role-based access control**.
- Handle **borrowing and return transactions** with clear activity tracking.
- Enforce **secure authentication and authorization** using Spring Security.
- Track **user activities** such as book creation, updates, deletions, borrowing, and returning, with detailed logs.

The system is designed to be **scalable, secure, and extensible**, following clean architecture principles and best practices for modern Spring Boot applications.

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

- **Authentication**: Implemented using **Spring Security** with **Basic Auth**.  
  Users log in with a username and password stored securely in the database (hashed with BCrypt).  

- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with three main roles:
  - **ADMIN** ‚Üí Full access (manage users, books, members, transactions).  
  - **LIBRARIAN** ‚Üí Manage books, borrowing/return transactions, and members.  
  - **STAFF** ‚Üí Limited access (manage members and borrowing/return operations).  

- Endpoints are protected using `@PreAuthorize` and `HttpSecurity` rules in `SecurityConfig`.  
- Example:
  ```java
  .requestMatchers("/api/books/**").hasAnyAuthority("ADMIN", "LIBRARIAN")
  .requestMatchers("/api/members/**").hasAnyAuthority("ADMIN", "LIBRARIAN", "STAFF")

---
## üìù Activity Logging

- All **critical actions** (`create`, `update`, `delete`, `borrow`, `return`) are automatically logged using a custom **Spring AOP Aspect**.  
- A custom annotation `@LogActivity` is also supported for marking extra methods that should be logged.  

Each log entry records:  
- **Username** of the acting user  
- **Action** performed (e.g., `CREATE_BOOK`, `DELETE_MEMBER`)  
- **Target class & method**  
- **Timestamp** 

Logs are stored via the `UserActivityLogService` and can be extended for persistence (e.g., database, file storage, or monitoring tools).

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- **UI/Frontend Integration**: Add a React or Angular frontend for easier interaction with the system.  
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Implement search by author, category, language, or publication year.  
- **Notifications**: Email/SMS reminders for due dates and overdue books.  
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Generate reports on borrowing trends, active members, and popular books.  
- **JWT Authentication**: Replace Basic Auth with JWT tokens for enhanced security.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate build, test, and deployment using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.  
- **Dockerization**: Provide Docker images for easier setup and deployment.  
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to AWS/Azure/GCP for scalability.
